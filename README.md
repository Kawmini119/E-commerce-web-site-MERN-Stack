# E-commerce-web-site-MERN-Stack
I developed an e-commerce simple website using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) for a  shoeshop. Admins can add, remove, and update shoe items and prices. Users can browse shoes, add to cart, remove from cart, and complete the checkout process. The site also features sign-in and sign-up for user authentication.
